# üóÑÔ∏è Project Structure

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # all the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- providers         # all of the application providers
|
+-- routes            # routes configuration
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- test              # test utilities and mock server
|
+-- types             # base types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, keep most of the code inside the `features` folder, which should contain different feature-based things. Every `feature` folder should contain domain specific code for a given feature. This will allow you to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a flat folder structure with many files.

A feature could have the following structure:

```sh
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- routes      # route components for a specific feature pages
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types for TS specific feature domain
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
|
+-- index.ts    # entry point for the feature, it should serve as the public API of the given feature and exports everything that should be used outside the feature
```

Everything from a feature should be exported from the `index.ts` file which behaves as the public API of the feature.

You should import stuff from other features only by using:

`import {AwesomeComponent} from "@/features/awesome-feature"`

and not

`import {AwesomeComponent} from "@/features/awesome-feature/components/awesome-component`

This can also be configured in the ESLint configuration to disallow the later import by the following rule:

```js
{
    rules: {
        'no-restricted-imports': [
            'error',
            {
                patterns: ['@/features/*/*'],
            },
        ],

    // ...rest of the configuration
}
```

To prevent circular dependencies, here is another ESLint rule that can be used:

```js
{
    rules: {
        'import/no-cycle': 'error',
    // ...rest of the configuration
}
```

This was inspired by how [NX](https://nx.dev/) handles libraries that are isolated but available to be used by the other modules. Think of a feature as a library or a module that is self-contained but can expose different parts to other features via its entry point. This approach will also make it easier to split the application in a monorepo in the future.

This way, you can ensure that the codebase is clean and easy to maintain.

If you are still getting circular dependencies, consider breaking the feature into smaller features or moving the shared code to the `lib` folder. Or you can always opt-out of the barrel export pattern and import the files directly.

Sometimes, it will make more sense to move the whole API layer to the `lib` folder, especially if it is shared across multiple features. The same goes for the `stores` folder. If you have a global store that is used across the entire application, it should be moved to the `stores` folder.
